## About this project
This project is a collaborative effort by a group of six students at Teknikh√∂gskolan in Lund, as part of a graded assignment. 
The contributors' details can be found further down in this document.
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust booking system tailored for a travel agency. This system empowers
the agency to efficiently manage customer records, make bookings for travel packages, and provide a cancellation process.

## Key objectives

### Test-Driven Design with JUnit 
The project's core focus is on honing skills in test-driven design, using JUnit for comprehensive test coverage. Through this process,
we aim to ensure the reliability and stability of the system.
### Feature Prioritization
During an intensive two-week sprint, we learned how to prioritize features to meet the demands of real-world development projects. 
This assignment provided valuable insights into the art of feature selection and delivery in a limited timeframe.

## Technologies used
- IntelliJ as IDE: While this project is terminal-based and compatible with various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), we utilized IntelliJ for its powerful features and development support.
- Java as Programming Language: Java serves as the foundation for our project, providing the reliability and scalability necessary for a robust booking system.
- SQL Cloud for Database: We harnessed the capabilities of SQL cloud services to ensure a secure and scalable database for our travel agency booking system.
- DataGrip for Database Management: DataGrip played a pivotal role in efficiently managing and maintaining our database, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
- Trello for Prioritization: Trello was our tool of choice for feature prioritization, allowing us to manage tasks, collaborate, and track project progress effectively.
- Miro for Database Design: To visualize and plan the structure of our database, we used Miro, a collaborative online whiteboard.
- GitHub for Version Control: GitHub was our version control platform, facilitating collaborative development and providing a clear history of code changes and updates.
